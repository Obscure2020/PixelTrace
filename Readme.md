# PixelTrace (Very WIP)

Inspired by something that came up during my internship at Avery Dennison, I realized that I don't currently have a good program for tracing bitmaps into pixel-grid SVGs (_without_ just laying out one square for every pixel in the original image).

Time to pull a Thanos and "do it myself."

Progress on this will be slow. I have a lot less free time right now than I would like. Currently writing in Java 22 on Windows 11.
